# sum-of-digit-fractals
Random sum-of-digit exponential fractals visualized with Mathematica. 

Under the guidance of Professor Hildebrand, we worked to produce sum-of-digit fractals using Mathematica to render our results.

This work was done as part of undergraduate research at the Illinois Geometry Lab (IGL) during the spring semester of 2021.

## How to Run

- First, you will have to install the Wolfram-Alpha Mathematica computing system (for pricing see [here](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/)).
- Next, download the sumOfDigitFractals.wl file and give it a run locally, using the Run Code button.
- Finally, to see our full product, download the source code for the fractal-demonstrations.nb file, and see our code as it appears on the Wolfram Demonstrations page! (will be updated once the link is published)
